    "Data science is a rapidly expanding field and no degree program can hope to teach you everything that will be helpful to you as a data scientist. So it's important that you become familiar with looking up documentation and learning how to read it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a section of code that plots a three-dimensional \"wireframe\" plot. You'll see what that means when you draw it. Replace each `# Your answer here` with a description of what the line above does, what the arguments being passed in are, and how the arguments are used in the function. For example,\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** The `Shift` + `Tab` tip from earlier in the notebook may help here. Remember that objects must be defined in order for the documentation shortcut to work; for example, all of the documentation will show for method calls from `np` since we've already executed `import numpy as np`. However, since `z` is not yet defined in the kernel, `z.reshape(x.shape)` will not show documentation until you run the line `z = np.cos(squared)`."
